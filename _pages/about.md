<ins>PhD student at university Paris-Saclay</ins> under the supervision of Dominique Barth and Yann Strozecki. My field of interest is **Reinforcement Learning (RL)** and its applications. Currently, I work on RL for graphs and a possible coupling with classical operations research algorithms. In particular, we intend to use these methods in supply chain management to reduce costs and CO2 emissions.
